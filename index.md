Tofu: figure out everything. Maybe use reverie or some other template.



My stomach hurts. The airport air smells vaguely of disinfectant and feels stuffy through my mask. 
I brought a portable breakfast, but I have no appetite so it's stuffed into my backpack between a travel pillow and a book. 
The old woman sitting in the row of seats opposite me keeps looking at me, but I suppose I only notice because I keep looking at her. 
I try to focus on my phone where I'm writing this blog and not on the knot in my stomach. 
I brought my phone, my charger, my laptop, its charger, my headphones, their charger, and an Iceland travel guide in my carry-on backpack. 
My electronics are at 100%, and I somehow feel both over charged and completely drained. 
I brought eight pairs of socks (two wool), seven underwear, seven shirts, three pairs of pants, two beanies, one hoodie, one heavy coat, a pair of gloves, flipflops (for the hot springs), heavy boots, and a pair of tennis shoes.
The gate speakers crackled on and are asking for volunteers to check their carry-on bags. The old woman has gone. 
My anxiety has been slowly growing since I bought the tickets a month ago. Or maybe it has been growing over the last lonely year. Or maybe longer. 
The dreams started two weeks ago. Unfamiliar languages, strange locations, being hunted, hiding. 
I have three new apps on my phone, reservations at four different hotels, a Ring Road tour booking, and a gap of over a month where I still need to schedule an Airbnb. 
I'm bringing my toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, and a pair of scissors for my beard. I'm bringing a ticket that says boarding group D, owing to my late check-in. 
I'm bringing a list of things to bring back: a wool sweater, a shirt, and some post stamps for my friend. I'm bringing a tangled ball of anxiety, but I hope to leave that behind. 
They're boarding now.


My queasiness has subsided by the time I land in Seattle. Perhaps the constant drone of the engines wore it away, or perhaps the body can only be in that state for so long. As I pass through the food court, the scent of fried food brings my appetite back with a vengeance. One brief Pei Wei orange chicken later I'm exploring the Seattle Tacoma airport. As I often do when I have time to spare, I open Pokémon Go on my phone. It's with some mild shock that I realize I've already visited some of the stops. It was only a couple of years ago but feels like a lifetime. I take a moment to remember the old forests of Olympic National Park. The chill of the air, the fresh dew, walking among ancients older than this country. It is a welcome touch of serenity, and I continue my journey with optimism.
