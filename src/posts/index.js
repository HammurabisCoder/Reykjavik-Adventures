/* TODOM: More notes.
July 4th - At my mom's suggestion, I have a hot dog for lunch. It seemed like a pretty American thing to do. Walked 
out to the solar sailer at midnight to sit and watch the ocean. I expected a moment of quiet solitude but there were a
couple of fishermen on the rocks down by the ocean, and a photographer shooting the sculpture from different angles. It probably
would have been more impressive if the skies were clearer and you could see the colors of the sunset. One night, perhaps.
Louder than either, there must have been a school of fish near the shore, and they constantly splashed the surface. I imagine
the fishermen had a good catch. I sat on a rock for a few minutes before walking back to the apartment.

July 5th - finally feeling healthy again. At least, after taking a 3 hour nap in the early afternoon.
Finally did a bit of organizing around my airbnb apartment rather than the pile of clothes on the ground.

July 6th - After giving myself the weekend to just rest and recover, I'm getting back to a semblance of routine. I went to a cafe
before work for breakfast and to work on the blog again, first time since I got it up at Perlan. After this, I'm going to get a
boba tea to steel myself and then try to do laundry finally. It's in a cramped cellar shared with 3 other apartments, and I still
feel somewhat like a trespasser here. So I'm somewhat anxious about running into the other people doing it. It's illogical, but
of course most anxiety usually is. Also, there's no dryer, just some clothes lines strewn up around the cramped cellar. I think
I'll try to bring them into the apartment and drape them strategically around the place instead.
