#### June 19, 2021 by Matthias

Finally, something resembling a blog. I'm at Perlan again, on the top slowly rotating restaurant.
I just had a scoop of chocolate ice cream and am sipping on some mango tea as I type this.
The parents arrived yesterday, and they're going through the museum now while I wait for them up here.
This blog/website is super jank, but it's a start. Now to start collecting and backfilling my old scattered notes from
text files, Facebook posts, and my notepad.
